# Speech_Saver

A perfect speech aid that reminds you what to say during a speech.

- A frontend UI that helps you set up the device, from mode selection to speech keyword extraction

- An NLP model that involves word embeddings generation and word similarity calculation will real-time the content of your speech, and when it thinks you haven't covered something, it will remind you!

- After the speech, it will generate a report about your overall behavior during the speech, what you are doing well and what to be improved!
